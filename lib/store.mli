type t
(** The type for store handlers. *)

val remote: ?uri:Uri.t -> unit -> t Lwt.t

    the location of the Irmin daemon. *)

val local: ?root:string -> unit -> t Lwt.t
(** Create a local store handler, using Irmin's Git on-disk
    backend. [root] is the filesystem location to the Git repository
    holding the store contents. *)

type 'a callback = 'a -> unit Lwt.t
(** The type for callbacks. *)

type cancel = unit callback
(** The type for watch cancelling functions. *)

val with_transaction:
  ?retry:int -> t -> string ->  (t -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit Lwt.t
(** [with_transaction t f] executes [f t] in a transaction and commit
    the final result if the transaction is successful. Will retry
    multiple times in case of conflict (default is 5) with an
    exponential back-off. Raise [Invalid_argument] if the transaction
    is still not successful after all the retries. *)

(** The signature for objects kept in the store. *)
module type S = sig

  type id
  (** Type type for stable identifier of values kept in the store. *)

  (** The type for values kept in the store. *)

  val add: t -> value -> unit Lwt.t

  val mem: t -> id -> bool Lwt.t
  (** [mem t id] is true if a value with the stable identifer [id] is
      stored in [t]. *)
