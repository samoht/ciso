(** Task workers.

    A task worker translate tasks into a graph of jobs to run, for the
    various host ocnfigurations and compiler switches.

*)

type t
(** The type for task workers. *)

val worker: t -> Worker.t
(** [worker t] is [t]'s worker value. *)

type callback = t -> Task.t -> (Job.t -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit Lwt.t
(** Type for task workers' callbacks. *)

val default_callback: callback
(** [default_callback] is the callback calling the OPAM solver to
    resolve tasks into jobs. *)

val start: ?callback:callback -> ?host:Host.t -> ?tick:float ->
  opam_root:string -> Store.t -> t Lwt.t
(** [start ~opam_root s] starts a task worker process using the given
    OPAM root to store OPAM state. It uses [s] to synchronise with the
    scheduler and to store built objects. It also uses [s] to notify
    to the scheduler that it is alive.

    [tick] specifies how often the worker write into the store to
    notify that it is alive (default is every 5s). If not set,
    [callback] is {!default_callback}. If not specified, [host] is
    {!Host.detect ()}.

*)

val stop: t -> unit Lwt.t
(** [stop t] stops the task worker. *)
